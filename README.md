# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-and-Analytics  
*(Tentative Title — To Be Finalized)*  

---

##  Objective  
The objective of this project is to **analyze and predict heart-related health issues** by identifying potential risk factors and forecasting the likelihood of heart attacks or related fatalities in the future.  
Our goal is to assist in **early detection, prevention, and better healthcare decisions** through data-driven insights.

##  Description  
This project explores the relationships between various **health indicators** — including **age, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, BMI,** and **lifestyle habits** — to uncover meaningful patterns.  
By applying **statistical and machine learning techniques**, we aim to:  
-  Identify **key factors** influencing heart disease risks  
-  Predict the **probability of heart attacks** or cardiac events  
-  Visualize **mortality trends and risk distributions**  
-  Provide **actionable insights** to support preventive healthcare
