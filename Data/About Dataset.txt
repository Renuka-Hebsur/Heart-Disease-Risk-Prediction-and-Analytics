About Dataset:
Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
This dataset contains 1,888 records merged from five publicly available heart disease datasets. It includes 14 features that are crucial for predicting heart attack and stroke risks, covering both medical and demographic factors. Below is a detailed description of each feature.

Feature Descriptions:
age: Age of the patient (Numeric).
sex: Gender of the patient. Values: 1 = male, 0 = female.
cp: Chest pain type. Values: 0 = Typical angina, 1 = Atypical angina, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 3 = Asymptomatic.
trestbps: Resting Blood Pressure (in mm Hg) (Numeric).
chol: Serum Cholesterol level (in mg/dl) (Numeric).
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl. Values: 1 = true, 0 = false.
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results. Values: 0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy.
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric).
exang: Exercise-induced angina. Values: 1 = yes, 0 = no.
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (Numeric).
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment. Values: 0 = Upsloping, 1 = Flat, 2 = Downsloping.
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. Values: 0, 1, 2, 3.
thal: Thalassemia types. Values: 1 = Normal, 2 = Fixed defect, 3 = Reversible defect.
target: Outcome variable (heart attack risk). Values: 1 = more chance of heart attack, 0 = less chance of heart attack.

Dataset Details:
This dataset is a combination of five publicly available heart disease datasets, with a total of 1,888 records. Merging these datasets provides a more robust foundation for training machine learning models aimed at predicting heart attack risk.

Description:
This dataset includes 14 features known to contribute to heart attack risk. It is ideal for training machine learning models aimed at early detection and prevention of heart disease. The records have been cleaned by removing missing data to ensure data integrity. This dataset can be applied to various machine learning algorithms, including classification models such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and others.
